Approach: We decided to first work on laying the bones of the project and for the repository simultaneously and build from there, taking a breadth-first search approach to completing each task.Jeffrey got started on the coding aspect while Josselyn worked on getting the local repo and the Git repo communicating with each other. Noah came in with the assist towards the tail end and we were able to submit on time.

Coding issues:  	-Differentiating normal programing protocols with JUnit testing protocols
			-Simulating user input in run-time
			-Scanner method and input streams while testing
			-Adding @Test annotation in JUnit testing API 


Repo issues: 	Initially created the readme file via BASH in the local repo and did not have a "clean" repo resulting the following errors: 
		
			
			-file has no upstream branch
			-src refspec master does not match any
		 	-failure to push refs (master --> master fetch first)
		        -Fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
		
		The following commands were used to mitigate the errors:
		
			git remote add origin <repo url>
		
			git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories

			git commit -m "<commit message>"

			git add * <adds everything that's changed>

			git config --global user.name <git username>

			git remote add origin <git url>

			git clone <repo url>
